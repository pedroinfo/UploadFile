### .NET file upload examples

<hr>
In the projects we work on, a very common situation is to store files. 
Many organizations use a database for this and store it in column of bytes. Others use file systems and in other cases more modern technologies like amazon's S3. 


In this repository my idea is to put some possible situations to solve this challenge.



- Store files in Database (SQL Server + EF CORE).
  Do you need to upload files to the database? Dont do this. But if you want to do it, this is a small example.
  
- Store files in FileSystem

- Upload of files using ajax

- Upload of files using a progress bar

- Upload of files using a Desktop Application (Windows Forms). ~~I hate stored procedures in general~~, but sometimes we need use. 

- Store Files using LiteDB :)

- Upload files to a WebApi.



Feel free to comment the code or send me any suggestions.
